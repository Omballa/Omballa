## Hi there 👋

## Welcome to My Coding Wonderland! 🚀

### About Me

I'm a Software Engineering student 👨‍💻 who's head over heels for anything and everything in the vast realm of technology. By day, I'm diving into the world of React, React Native, Flutter, Python, and Node.js, creating sleek and interactive front-end experiences, and crafting robust back-end solutions. But when the sun sets, you'll find me immersed in my favorite hobby – creating games 🎮. I believe games are the art of Software Development, a canvas where you can paint your world and share it with people. It's not just about coding; it's about storytelling and creating experiences!

### Data Enthusiast 📊

Recently crowned with a Google Certification in Data Analytics 🎓, I've embarked on a thrilling adventure in the Data Science universe! 🌌 Enrolled in a Data Science Bootcamp, I'm delving into the fascinating realms of Machine Learning and beyond. I strongly believe that data is the "new oil" 💡, shaping the future in ways we can't even imagine. Let's analyze, visualize, and predict the future together!
